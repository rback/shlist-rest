  # ============================== LICENSE KEY ===============================
  # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic
  # account.  This key binds your Agent's data to your account in the
  # New Relic service.
  license_key: ''

  # Agent Enabled
  # Use this setting to disable the agent instead of removing it from the startup command.
  # Default is true.
  agent_enabled: true

  # Set the name of your application as you'd like it show up in New Relic.
  # If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application.
  # Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications)
  # to this application. To report data to more than one application
  # (useful for rollup reporting), separate the application names with ";".
  # For example, to report data to "My Application" and "My Application 2" use this:
  # app_name: My Application;My Application 2
  # This setting is required.
  app_name: shlist

  # To enable high security, set this property to true. When in high
  # security mode, the agent will use SSL and obfuscated SQL. Additionally,
  # request parameters and message parameters will not be sent to New Relic.
  high_security: false

  # Set to true to enable support for auto app naming.
  # The name of each web app is detected automatically
  # and the agent reports data separately for each one.
  # This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for
  # web apps in New Relic.
  # Default is false.
  enable_auto_app_naming: false

  # Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming.
  # Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction.
  # Default is true.
  enable_auto_transaction_naming: true

  # The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging
  # separate from that of your application.  Specify the log level here.
  # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application.
  # The levels in increasing order of verboseness are:
  #   off, severe, warning, info, fine, finer, finest
  # Default is info.
  log_level: warning

  # Log all data sent to and from New Relic in plain text.
  # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application.
  # Default is false.
  audit_mode: false

  # The number of backup log files to save.
  # Default is 1.
  log_file_count: 1

  # The maximum number of kbytes to write to any one log file.
  # The log_file_count must be set greater than 1.
  # Default is 0 (no limit).
  log_limit_in_kbytes: 0

  # Override other log rolling configuration and roll the logs daily.
  # Default is false.
  log_daily: false

  # The name of the log file.
  # Default is newrelic_agent.log.
  log_file_name: newrelic_agent.log

  # The log file directory.
  # Default is the logs directory in the newrelic.jar parent directory.
  #log_file_path:

  # The agent communicates with New Relic via https by
  # default.  If you want to communicate with newrelic via http,
  # then turn off SSL by setting this value to false.
  # This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your
  # application code, so response times will not be directly affected
  # by this change.
  # Default is true.
  ssl: true

  # Proxy settings for connecting to the New Relic server:
  # If a proxy is used, the host setting is required.  Other settings
  # are optional.  Default port is 8080.  The username and password
  # settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges
  # from a proxy server.
  #proxy_host: hostname
  #proxy_port: 8080
  #proxy_user: username
  #proxy_password: password

  # Limits the number of lines to capture for each stack trace.
  # Default is 30
  max_stack_trace_lines: 30

  # Provides the ability to configure the attributes sent to New Relic. These
  # attributes can be found in transaction traces, traced errors, Insight's
  # transaction events, and Insight's page views.
  attributes:

    # When true, attributes will be sent to New Relic. The default is true.
    enabled: false

    #A comma separated list of attribute keys whose values should
    # be sent to New Relic.
    #include:

    # A comma separated list of attribute keys whose values should
    # not be sent to New Relic.
    #exclude:

  # Analytics Events are used for Histograms and Percentiles. Unaggregated data is collected
  # for each web transaction and sent to the server on harvest.
  analytics_events:

    # Set to false to disable analytics events.
    # Default is true.
    enabled: true

    # Events are collected up to the configured amount. Afterwards, events are sampled to
    # maintain an even distribution across the harvest cycle. Largest value accepted is 10000.
    # Default is 2000.  Setting to 0 will disable.
    max_samples_stored: 2000

  # Cross Application Tracing adds request and response headers to
  # external calls using supported HTTP libraries to provide better
  # performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents.
  cross_application_tracer:

    # Set to false to disable cross application tracing.
    # Default is true.
    enabled: true

  # New Relic Real User Monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are
  # experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for
  # your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount
  # of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page.
  browser_monitoring:

    # By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to
    # inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Not all rendering engines are supported.
    # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/java/real-user-monitoring-in-java#manual_instrumentation
    # for instructions to add these manually to your pages.
    # Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior.

    # This instrumentation reports the name of the user principal returned from
    # HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() when servlets and filters are invoked.
